My research is in data science and AI for scientific applications.
It is by nature interdisciplinary.
It focuses on developping computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning methods for analysing data from other sciences.
The application domains that I consider are from two broad categories: sciences of the environment, and human sciences.
There is a special focus on the (astro)physics and medical fields.
My research is both applied and theoretical. It aims to develop new tools to support research in its application domains.
It also aims to further developments in AI, motivated by new challenges from the scientific data.
One strong challenge, that is common to all considered application domains, is the need for interpretable methods and results.

Research themes
======
* Computer vision, machine learning, deep learning
* Human sciences & medical applications
* Physics & astrophysics applications
* Interpretable AI through the integration of domain knowledge into the design of AI methods
