I am an associate professor at [Université de Toulon](https://www.univ-tln.fr/) and [Laboratoire d'Informatique et Systèmes (LIS)](https://www.lis-lab.fr/) in the field of data science and AI for scientific applications. My research is by nature interdisciplinary. It focuses on developping computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning methods for analysing data from other sciences. The application domains that I consider are from two broad categories: sciences of the environment, and human sciences, with a special focus on the (astro)physics and medical fields. My research is both applied, with the aim to develop new tools to support research in these application domains, and more theoretical, with further developments in AI being motivated by new challenges from the scientific data.
