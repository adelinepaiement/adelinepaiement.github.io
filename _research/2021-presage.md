[PRESAGE](https://presage.lis-lab.fr/) (2021-2025): PREdicting Solar Activity using machine learning on heteroGEneous data

Summary 
======
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
PRESAGE brings together data scientists and solar physicists to develop new machine learning methods that support a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of solar activity in order to predict its events. The solar physics community is currently facing a deluge of data, which is too widely varied and complex to allow an overall analysis leading to a global understanding of solar activity. We propose to solve this problem by developing new machine learning algorithms that exploit these heterogeneous data, to:
</div>
<ol>
<li>study the properties in 3D of objects of the solar atmosphere (filaments, sunspots…),</li>
<li>model their evolutions and behaviors,</li>
<li>study the correlations between many indicators of solar activity (inc. solar objects and their behaviors), solar activity events (flares, CMEs…), and their resulting terrestrial impacts (geomagnetic indices…), and</li>
<li>use these new insights to predict the events of solar activity and their effects on Earth.</li>
