Summary 
======

This project introduces a new formulation of the level set method that allows 3D/4D modelling from sparse data volumes.
It performs simultaneous registration, 3D/4D segmentation, and shape interpolation.
This plateform has been tested with various tomographic medical images and with Kinect's 3D point clouds.
